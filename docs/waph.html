        <h5 class="text-primary">Course Information</h5>
        <p>
            In this course, we studied basic web application development using front-end technologies (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end components (PHP/MySQL).
            Web application vulnerabilities and attacks were introduced through hands-on exercises and secure programming practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            We completed multiple labs, hands-on tasks, and hackathons throughout the course.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4 text-primary">Overview of Lab 0</h5>
        <p>
            This lab was done in two parts. In Part 1, I installed and configured an Ubuntu virtual machine and essential software including net-tools, Sublime Text, Git, Pandoc, Apache 2, Google Chrome, and Wireshark. 
            In Part 2, I cloned the course repository from GitHub and created an SSH key pair to enable credential-free Git operations.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4 text-primary">Overview of Lab 1</h5>
        <p>
            This lab covered HTTP protocol and basic web app programming.
            <ul>
                <li>Task 1: Using Wireshark to understand HTTP traffic</li>
                <li>Task 2: HTTP protocol using Telnet and Wireshark</li>
                <li>Task 3: CGI Web apps in C</li>
                <li>Task 4: Simple PHP app with user input</li>
                <li>Task 5: Understanding GET and POST requests</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4 text-primary">Overview of Lab 2</h5>
        <p>
            This lab had two tasks: Task 1 was creating a basic HTML page with forms and JavaScript.
            Task 2 included using Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and integrating Web APIs. All tasks were done on a virtual machine using Sublime Text.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4 text-primary">Overview of Hackathon 1</h5>
        <p>
            This hackathon focused on cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. I performed XSS attacks at multiple levels and learned defense methods using hands-on lecture-based exercises.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4 text-primary">Overview of Individual Project</h5>
        <p>
            The individual project was to build a professional portfolio targeting potential employers. It included the resume and extra tasks such as clocks, API integration, and cookie-based features â€” all deployed on GitHub.
